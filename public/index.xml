      <description>Hi! This is supposed to be the first of (hopefully) many posts to come. I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off starting a blog for a long time - Google Keep/Joplin isn&amp;rsquo;t the best place to document technical learnings. With this, I hope to organize and reflect on whatever I learn during my development journey that I feel is worth documenting. Maybe throw in some rants as well.
Just use Medium? I intended to start writing on Medium initially until it occurred to me that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t allow me to customize my blog.</description>
